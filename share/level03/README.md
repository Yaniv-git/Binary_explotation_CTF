There are many useful tools installed via python pwntools

for example 

this creates unique pattern
```
root@44d54daad910:/home/share# cyclic 100
aaaabaaacaaadaaaeaaafaaagaaahaaaiaaajaaakaaalaaamaaanaaaoaaapaaaqaaaraaasaaataaauaaavaaawaaaxaaayaaa

root@44d54daad910:/home/share# cyclic -l faaa
20
```

you can also `hex` and `unhex` from shell, and more... (type shellcraft to see more options)
